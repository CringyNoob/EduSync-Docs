Visual evidence helps admin understand the problem quickly.

"Room 401, 4th Floor, CSE Building" is better than "CSE".

### ⏰ Mention Timing
If the issue occurs at specific times, mention it.

### 🤝 Check for Duplicates
Search if someone already reported it - upvote instead of duplicating.

If admin asks for more details, respond promptly.
